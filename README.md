Pemba
-----

A (very) simple evil twin access point captive portal suite. Can also be used as a regular captive portal for simple cases easily.

Why "Pemba" ?
-------------

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_twin:

>Pemba, grew tired of being confined. In attempting to escape, he proved himself treacherous. The rip he caused in the cosmic egg begat the Earth. It also compelled Mangala to seek a sacrifice of atonement. For this, Mangala killed Pemba's innocent fraternal twin, Faro. When Faro's remains were scattered on the newly formed Earth, fertile land was formed.

I have a fetish for symbolic names.
